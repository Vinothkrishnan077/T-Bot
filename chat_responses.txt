Question: give me the PayPal Fees for Merchants details with points
Response: - Transaction Fees: PayPal charges a percentage of each transaction, which varies by country, currency, and the payment method used.
- For example, for U.S.-based transactions, the fee is usually:
    - 3.49% + $0.49 per transaction for standard domestic payments.
    - 4.99% per transaction for international payments.
- For international transactions, fees are higher due to currency conversions, which can vary by region.
- Other Fee Details:
    - Currency Conversion Fees: When accepting payments in foreign currencies, there is an additional charge of around 3-4% of the transaction.
    - Micropayments: If you frequently process small transactions (under $10), you can opt for micropayment pricing, which charges 5% + $0.05 per transaction.
